# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock paper scissors game built with a general UI. A player plays against a computer where the first one to 5 wins. The user inputs their choice by clicking on the corresponding button. The game can be reset to play again with the play again button when either the player or computer hits 5 wins first.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JS

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate the DOM by selecting elements and using them to make user inputs such as picking rock, paper, scissors, or try again. I also learned how to create elements and use it when needed to through JavaScript.
